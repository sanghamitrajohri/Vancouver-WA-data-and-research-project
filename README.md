# Vancouver-WA-data-and-research-project

This repository contains various projects and analyses focused on **energy consumption**, **census demographics**, and **building characteristics**, among others. These projects are part of my work under **June Lukyu** at the **University of Washington (UW)**. Below is an overview of the contents, methodology, and insights derived from the data.

## **Objective**

To analyze energy consumption patterns across zip codes and understand the role of **socioeconomic factors**, **housing characteristics**, and **demographics**.
